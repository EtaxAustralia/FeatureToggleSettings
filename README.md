# Etax FeatureToggle Settings

This is the temporary repository for distributing the currently set values for our feature toggles. This will be eventually replaced with a service in the engineering cluster. To access the actual json file you should be able to use a URL like `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EtaxAustralia/FeatureToggleSettings/master/$Environment/$Product/features.json`.

If you're a member of the public reading this, Welcome! This is probably not what you want. Might i recommend Https://www.etax.com.au for all your Australian Tax filing needs.
